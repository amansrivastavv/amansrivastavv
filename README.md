# 🚀 Hey there, I'm Aman Srivastav
> "Learning every day, building one line of code at a time."

I'm a passionate **Front-End Developer** with hands-on experience in creating responsive, user-friendly websites using technologies like:

- ✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- ✅ Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
- ✅ React.js, Next.js  
- ✅ Git & GitHub  

## 🛠️ My Journey So Far

I have **real-world experience** in frontend development, working on live projects and solving real user problems. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and improving with every project I build.

## 📚 Currently Learning

I'm on a mission to **master Full-Stack Web Development**.  
Right now, I'm learning:

- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB  
- TypeScript  
- System Design Basics  


## 📁 My GitHub = My Digital Notebook

Whatever I learn, I **document it in detail** and push it to GitHub —  
so I can revise it later, and maybe help someone else on their learning path. 💡

You’ll find:

- Well-explained mini-projects
- Concept-based repositories (like localStorage, API, etc.)
- Clean and readable code files with comments


## 🤝 Let’s Connect & Collaborate

If you ever find something in my code that can be improved —  
feel free to fork, suggest, or just reach out to me.  
I’m always open to feedback, learning, and collaboration.
