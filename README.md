# 🚀 Hello, I'm Aman Srivastav

> *"Consistent efforts beat talent when talent doesn’t show up consistently."*

I'm a dedicated **Front-End Developer** with practical experience in building clean, responsive, and user-focused web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into real, functional products using:

- ✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java  
- ✅ Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, Material UI  
- ✅ React.js, Next.js  
- ✅ Git & GitHub  

I use this GitHub as both my **project showcase** and **learning journal**.

## 🧠 GitHub: My Learning Journal

Everything I learn — whether it’s a concept, mini-project, or real-world logic — I document and upload here on GitHub.

This helps me:

- Revisit and revise concepts anytime  
- Track my growth clearly  
- Share knowledge that might help others too  

Feel free to explore my repositories. You’ll find:

- Well-structured codebases  
- Concept-based examples (like localStorage, API fetching)
